# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived scripts and files that are no longer actively maintained but are kept for historical reference.

## Contents

- **old_analysis.py**: Legacy data analysis script (deprecated as of 2024-12-20)

## Guidelines

1. Files in this directory should not be used in production
2. All archived files should include deprecation warnings
3. Consider removing files older than 2 years unless they have historical significance
4. Document the reason for archival and replacement solutions

## Migration Notes

If you need functionality from archived scripts, please check the current codebase for updated implementations or contact the development team for guidance.
